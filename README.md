# Timoshenko Beam Analysis using FEM and VEM

This repository contains an implementation of the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** and **Virtual Element Method (VEM)** for the static analysis of **Timoshenko beam theory**.

The focus of this work is on:
- Verification of numerical formulations
- h-convergence studies
- Slenderness effects
- Comparison between FEM and VEM
- Symbolic derivation of the stiffness matrix
